Game Concept:
Welcome to a classic fantasy RPG world where players can create unique characters to embark on epic adventures. The world is filled with warriors, mages, rogues, and clericsâ€”each with their own strengths and magical abilities.

Design Choices:
Each class was designed with different strengths to reflect traditional RPG archetypes:

I used the basic classes that was provided in the documentation

I used my knowledge I gained from playing games like Elden Ring.
- Warrior: High strength and health, low magic. A great choice for combat.
- Mage: High magic, low strength, moderate health. Reigns supreme in spell-casting.
- Rogue: Balanced strength and magic, lower health. Agile and versatile.
- Cleric: Moderate strength, strong magic, high health. resilient.



Creativity:
with the use of Ai I used
- Stat Recalculation on Level-Up: When a character levels up, their stats are recalculated using the same logic as character creation, ensuring consistency and scalability.
- Flexible File Saving/Loading: Characters can be saved to and loaded from text files using a structured format. The system handles missing files and malformed input gracefully

Ai Usage:
- Designing and refining the save_character() function, especially for file I/O error handling.
- Improving key normalization logic in load_character() to handle variations in file formatting.
- Recommending stat recalculation during level-up for consistency.


How to run:
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Save the main program file as `project1_starter.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the program using:
To run automated tests (if using pytest):
Save the test file as test_project1.py in the same directory.
Run: pytest test_project1.py
